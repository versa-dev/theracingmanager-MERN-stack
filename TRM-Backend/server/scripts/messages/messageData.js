        text: `This filly is a real queen. She is out of the Stakes winning mare Cartimandua and by Cacique who covers a limited book of mares, but he has a fantastic strike rate with those foals he does get on the ground. He has produced 21% black type performers from foals of racing age and having raced two of his best progeny; Dominant and Census, we are extremely happy to be adding this stunning filly into our syndicates. Contentment ran three times as a two-year-old and was unlucky not to break her maiden having bumped into the subsequent Oh So Sharp Stakes (Gr 3) winner Poetâ€™s Vanity when second at Salisbury. She is a filly with plenty of class about her and is an exciting prospect for 2017.`

She's in very good form but if the ground was on the fast side she may not run as she came back after a run on quick ground at Ascot last year all jarred up.`
