“Ryan Moore was very complimentary about him,” said Middleham Park director of racing Tim Palin.
“He said he needed six furlongs and if we wanted to step him up in class, the Coventry would be the logical next step.`,

      description: `2016 was a record breaking year for us. Not only did we pass the landmark figure of 800 WINNERS since we were formed, but we earned over £1,200,000.00 in prize money-the highest amount we have ever achieved. We won the most pattern races of any year, with numerous placings also earning 'black type'. Let's not forget the St Leger runner up spot from Ventura Storm and to win our third Group 1 was certainly the highlight!
Tim Palin fell in love with racing in 1983 – all from placing a 25p each way bet on Teenoso in the Derby! He became a teacher in his 20’s and often went racing at the weekends and whilst looking on from outside the paddock, contemplated whether he would ever be lucky enough to be standing on the hallowed turf of the parade ring as an owner.`

She is out of the Stakes winning mare Cartimandua and by Cacique who covers a limited book of mares, but he has a fantastic strike rate with those foals he does get on the ground. He has produced 21% black type performers from foals of racing age and having raced two of his best progeny; Dominant and Census, we are extremely happy to be adding this stunning filly into our syndicates. Contentment ran three times as a two-year-old and was unlucky not to break her maiden having bumped into the subsequent Oh So Sharp Stakes (Gr 3) winner Poet’s Vanity when second at Salisbury. She is a filly with plenty of class about her and is an exciting prospect for 2017.`,

      description: `Highclere specialises in putting together small groups of people to share in a number of top quality racehorses. This enables people to own a share in a racehorse and to enjoy racing at the highest level without the very high costs normally associated with owning racehorses. Perhaps even more crucially, it gives our shareowners a significantly greater chance of success. Indeed, since its creation in 1992, twenty seven per cent of Highclere’s syndicates have produced Black Type performers (Group 1, 2, 3 and Listed races), making Highclere the most successful multiple ownership company in Europe
A large part of our success has been due to the selection process employed for purchasing yearlings. Since 1992 John Warren has purchased all of Highclere’s yearlings. John is one of the most talented and highly respected horsemen in the world, and has bought us a staggering seven champions in Lake Coniston, Tamarisk, Delilah, Petrushka, Motivator (the Royal Ascot Racing Club’s winner of the 2005 Group 1 Vodafone Derby), Memory (ROA Champion two-year-old Filly) and Harbinger.`
